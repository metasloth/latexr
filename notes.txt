===NOTES===
From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1017055/get-started-with-latex-on-linux
-Use tools such as xfig or dia to create diagrams.
These can be easily inserted into your documents in a
variety of formats. Note that if you are creating PDFs
then you shouldn't use EPS (encapsulated postscript)
for images

-Use pdf exported from your diagram editor if possible,
or you can use the epstopdf package to automatically
convert from (e)ps to pdf for figures included with
\includegraphics.

-Start using version control on your documents.

-Use make to run latex for you. When you start on
having bibliographies, images and other more complex
uses of latex you'll find that you need to run it
over multiple files or multiple times (the first time
updates the references, and the second puts references
into the document, so they can be out-of-date unless
you run latex twice...). Abstracting this into a
makefile can save a lot of time and effort.
